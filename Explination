Define the Application Pool Name:

$appPoolName = "YourAppPoolName"

This line defines a variable $appPoolName that holds the name of the IIS (Internet Information Services) application pool you want to manage.
Replace "YourAppPoolName" with the actual name of the application pool you want to stop and start.


Import the WebAdministration Module:

Import-Module WebAdministration

This line imports the WebAdministration module, which provides cmdlets for managing IIS, including application pools, websites, and other IIS components.
If this module is not already loaded in the PowerShell session, this command ensures that the necessary cmdlets are available.

Stop the Application Pool:

Stop-WebAppPool -Name $appPoolName
Write-Output "Application pool '$appPoolName' stopped."

Stop-WebAppPool is a cmdlet from the WebAdministration module that stops the specified IIS application pool.
The -Name parameter specifies the name of the application pool to stop, which is provided by the $appPoolName variable.
After stopping the application pool, Write-Output prints a confirmation message to the console indicating that the application pool has been stopped.

Start the Application Pool:

Start-WebAppPool -Name $appPoolName
Write-Output "Application pool '$appPoolName' started."

Start-WebAppPool is a cmdlet from the WebAdministration module that starts the specified IIS application pool.

The -Name parameter specifies the name of the application pool to start, using the same $appPoolName variable.
After starting the application pool, Write-Output prints a confirmation message to the console indicating that the application pool has been started.
Overall Functionality
This PowerShell script is designed to manage an IIS application pool by performing two main tasks:

Stop the Application Pool: Temporarily stops the specified application pool, which can be useful for maintenance, updates, or troubleshooting.

Start the Application Pool: Restarts the application pool, allowing it to resume processing requests.

This type of script is often used in scenarios where you need to refresh an application pool (e.g., after making configuration changes) or ensure it is in a clean state by stopping and starting it.
